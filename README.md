This englobes all developments which have been carried out to implement a real-time collision avoidance 
block for multi-UAV coordination in the ARCAS project. Main developer: David Alejo

All the implemented algorithm are described within my PhD. Thesis in Chapters 7 and 8.

Gazebo simulations are provided in order to test the functionality. 
All these tests can be found in the directories src/use_tg/experiments
