\*************************************************************/

- Setting the provided workspace:
	- source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
	- mkdir -p your_ws/src
	- cd your_ws/src
	- catkin_init_workspace
	- cd your_ws
	- catkin_make
	- source your_ws/devel/setup.bash
	- cp -R provided_ws/src/* your_ws/src/
	- Compile your_ws:
		- cd your_ws
		- catkin_make
	- Establish the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH environment variable:
		- export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=your_ws/src/FunctionalLayerPackages/Control/ual/models:your_ws/src/FunctionalLayerPackages/Control/ual/Media/models
	- Test the workspace:
		- Test Gazebo:
			- roslaunch ual testbed_pipes.launch or roslaunch ual testbed_arcas.launch
		- Add three hummingbirds:
			- roslaunch ual gazebo_nodes.launch
			- roslaunch ual testbed_arcas_multiuav.launch

- Dependencies:
	- Hydro desktop full version: sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full
	- Gazebo version 1.9.5
	- Metapackage hector_quadrotor: sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-hector* 
	- Set of ROS packages named 'gazebo_ros_pkgs': sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-gazebo-*
	- Other installed packages:
		- ros-hydro-message-to-tf

- Considerations
	- Due to the different functionality of the workspace, is difficult to test it fully.
	  If you detect any problem, please report us and we will solve it as soon as possible.

	- The QuadStateEstimationStamped message has been updated to the 
	  QuadStateEstimationWithCovarianceStamped message, like it was agreed in the Barcelona meeting.

	- Tested in Ubuntu 12.04.2 64bits and gcc 4.6.3.
