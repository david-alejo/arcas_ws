# It contains the state estimation of a quadrotor. It is formed by the data of position, attitude, lineal and angular velocity, acceleration, altitude above ground and attitude commands.



# The quadrotor position measured in meters [m] with respect to the testbed frame (also known as map frame or global frame).
Position position

# The quadrotor orientation measured in radians [rad] with respect to the quadrotor frame (body axes).
Attitude attitude

# The quadrotor lineal velocity measured in meters per second [m/s] with respect to the testbed frame (also known as map frame or global frame).
LinealVelocity lineal_velocity

# The quadrotor angular velocity measured in radians per second [rad/s] with respect to the quadrotor frame (body axes).
AngularVelocity angular_velocity

# The quadrotor altitude above ground measured in meters [m] with respect to the testbed frame (also known as map frame or global frame).
float64 altitude

# The quadrotor lineal acceleration measured in meters per squared [m/sÂ²] with respect to the testbed frame (also known as map frame or global frame).
