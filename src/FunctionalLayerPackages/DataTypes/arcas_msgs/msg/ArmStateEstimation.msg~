# This contains the state estimation of the robotic arm on board. That is, the velocity and position values of the arm angles and the battery position. The angle values are always given in the following order: Yaw1, Pitch1, Pitch2, Roll1 Pitch3, Roll2, Gripper. These angles are shown in the code API documentation of the arcas_msgs node and the developer manual of the functional layer.


# It indicates if the message is valid or not.
# If status = 1 => The data is valid.
# If status = 0 => The data is invalid (its values can be corrupted).
# A different value has no meaning but may be established by a particular application.
